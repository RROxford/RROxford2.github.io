          Welcome to the Reproducible Research Oxford project
        </h3>

<p><b>Reproducible Research Oxford</b> is a project based at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. The project aims to
  lay the groundwork for a culture of research reproducibility at Oxford, focusing on training in the effective use of computational tools
  in research. These tools are widely used in some disciplines, and they can enable researchers to easily track the process leading
  from data to results, so that it is fully reproducible. However, researchers often lack the opportunities, incentives and confidence
  to make best use of these tools.
</p>

<p>As part of the project, we have set up a partnership between the University of Oxford and
  <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software</a>/<a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, non-profit volunteer
  organisations focused on teaching researchers across disciplines the computing and data skills they need for effective and reproducible
  research. We will coordinate and deliver a series of Software/Data Carpentry workshops open to students and staff across the University.
  Additionally, we will train Software/Data Carpentry instructors based at Oxford to build local capacity in this area.
</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>
          We are a group of researchers based at the University of Oxford who are passionate about research reproducibility and open research.
          The project aims to bring together expertise in these areas from across the University, and our members work in a diverse range of
          disciplines in the natural, medical, and social sciences, and in the humanities.
        </p>


<h3>Contact</h3>
        
        <p>Are you passionate about reproducibility and open research? There are several ways to get involved, from attending a workshop
          to joining the project team! We are also looking for volunteers to help out with coordinating and running the workshops.</p>

        <p>For announcements about future workshops and related activities, check our website, <a href="https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/info/rroxford">subscribe to our mailing list</a> and

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<p>This project aims to lay the groundwork for a culture of research reproducibility at Oxford, focusing on training in the effective use of computational tools in research.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
